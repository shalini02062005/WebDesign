My dog Sasha is my best friend She likes to chase the soccer ball when I practice.
It is so funny to see her running down the field trying to catch the ball with her mouth. It just won't fit!

Once Sasha saved my life When I was only years old. I started to go into the street to get a ball that had rolled across the treat. Of course I did not think to look for canal Sasha got in front of me and knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk. I was mod until I saw the car go by where I would have been Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was!
